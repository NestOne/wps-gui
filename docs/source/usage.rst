Usage
######

The WPS-GUI allow to create workflows that can be later easily executed and reproduced. Processes available to define a workflow are provided by the standard set of processes available in a defautl GeoServer installation.

Using the WPS-GUI involve the following steps:

- Adding the processes that are to be included in the workflow
- Setting the inputs for the processes. Those inputs might come from other processes, establishing a link between them and creating a chain of processes.
- Running  a process to obtain its output.

These steps are discussed in detail in the following sections.

Adding a process to the workflow
**********************************

To add a process to a workflow, select it from the list of them in the left-hand side of the window, and drag it onto the canvas. The process will be added in the place where you drop it, and it will contain on central element representing the process itself, along with individual elements representing each one of the inputs it requires and the outputs it produces.

To remove a process from the workflow, click on it (on the central element that represents the process, not any of the elements representing inputs or outputs) and press the backspace jey. The process will be removed from the canvas.

Setting the inputs
*******************

Input used by a process are rendered in the canvas in two colors: light brown for those input parameters that are not mandatory, and a darker brown for those that are mandatory. 

.. figure:: param_colors.png


If the parameter has already been asigned a value, the polygon representing it will have a normal line. 

.. figure:: normal_line.png

If the parameter hasn't been asigned yet, it will be rendered with a dashed line.

.. figure:: dashed_line.png

Before being able to run an algorithm, all of its mandatory inputs must be assigned.

There are two ways of setting a value for a given parameters: selecting/entering the value directly in the *Inputs* tab and linking the input to the output of a previous process.

Setting an input using the Inputs tab
--------------------------------------

To set the value for a parameter using a value not produced by another algorithm, just click on the parameter name. In the right-hand side of the window, in the *Inputs* tab, you will see an element corresponding to the parameter where the value can be entered or selected. The type of the element depends on the type of parameter. For instance, for a string or numeric input you will have a textbox, 

.. figure:: textbox.png

while for the case of a raster layer, you will have a dropdown box where you can select from the list of the raster layers available in the GeoServer instance.

.. figure:: raster_layer.png

Once you have entered or selected the value that you want to use for the parameter, click on the *Save* button. That will store the value in the parameter. For some parameter types, some validation routines are run before storing the value. If the value is not correct and does not validate, you will see a label indicating it.

.. figure:: invalid_value.png

Certain parameters allow multiple values to be used (the parameter has a ``maxOccurs`` parameter larger than 1). In that case, you will see a button named *+1 [parameter_name]*. Clicking on it will cause a new item to be added in the canvas as a parameter. 

.. figure:: add_params.png

In the image above, notice how 2 additional "levels" parameters have been added to Barnes Surface process, which originally contains just one of them

Click on the button as many times as you need for entering your configuration, and then set the values of each of the new parameters individually. The WPS-GUI will then gather all the values with the same parameter name and build a multiple value to be passed to the process.

Running a process
******************

Any of the processes that are included in a workflow can be executed and its output obtained. To do so, select the process central element in the canvas and then click on the *Run process* button in the upper part of the window.

If the process depends on other processes (that is, it uses the output of another process as input), the processes it depends on will be executed as well. Outputs generated by those processes will, however, not be offered to the user, and just treated as intermediate results.

In the most typical case, you will be creating a linear model with chained processes, and then you will run the last of them, so you get the output and execute all the previous processes in the chain before obtaining the final result.

Result are shown on the *Results* tab on the right-hand side of the window, or downloaded, depending on the characteristics of the output data itself.

For vector layers, results will be shown in a map if the CRS of the layer is either EPSG:4326 or EPSG:3857, the two CRSs natively supported by OpenLayers3.

Otherwise, the resulting layer will be printed as GML in a textbox

.. figure:: layer_as_gml.png

For raster layers, the result will be shown in a map if the CRS is either EPSG:4326 or EPSG:3857. Otherwise, a tif file with the resulting layer will be downloaded.
